* Liquibase 4.32.0 derby view problem repro

With liquibase 4.32.0 <viewExists> and <dropView> stopped working on derby.  This is the test case for [[https://github.com/liquibase/liquibase/issues/7003][liquibase issue 7003]].

To reproduce clone and build this project (the "mvn install" will fail because of a liquibase changelog exception):
#+begin_example
  mkdir -p ~/git
  cd ~/git/
  git clone https://github.com/steinarb/liquibase-derby-view-problem-repro.git
  cd ~/git/liquibase-derby-view-problem-repro/
  mvn install
#+end_example

To test with liquibase 4.32.1, change the liquibase.version maven property, the command below will run without failing:
#+begin_example
  cd ~/git/liquibase-derby-view-problem-repro/
  mvn -Dliquibase.version=4.31.1 clean install
#+end_example
